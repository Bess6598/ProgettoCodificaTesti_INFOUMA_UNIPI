            To Sherlock Holmes she is always <emph>_the_</emph> woman. I have seldom heard
            him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
            predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
            akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
            were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He
            was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
            the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a
            false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
            and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent
            for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the
            trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and
            finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
            might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
            instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
            be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
            yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
            Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

            I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
            from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
            interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
            of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;
            while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole
            Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among
            his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and
            ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his
            own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study
            of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers
            of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
            mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
            From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
            summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing
            up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
            and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
            successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
            his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
            the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

            One night <hi rend="italic">-it was on the 20th of March, 1888-</hi>I was returning from a
            journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
            my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
            door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
            with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
            keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
            extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
            looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
            against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
            head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.
